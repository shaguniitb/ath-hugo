## Abstract

Social media content creators on sites like YouTube are suffering due to severe harassment. Members of minoritized groups, such as women, Jews, people of color, and LGBTQ+ creators, are especially at risk for identity-based harassment. This harassment is typically experienced in the form of hateful comments creators receive on their content. In an original user research study, ADL finds that YouTube creators who face harassment, especially identity-based harassment, are stressed and overwhelmed moderating these comments. To help alleviate this we propose instead a user-centered, collaborative tool that enables creators to moderate their comments automatically, using customizable templates they can share.
