## Abstract

 This paper argues that designers and community managers can leverage Focus Theory of Normative Conduct to motivate constructive user behaviors in online communities as well as shape positive perceptions of community moderation among their users. I provide evidence from my prior research to show how opportunities exist in modifying design elements and moderation procedures to emphasize community norms that may encourage productive outcomes.
