## Abstract

This panel will bring together a group of scholars from diverse methodological backgrounds to discuss critical aspects of data col- lection for CSCW research. This discussion will consider the rapidly evolving ethical, practical, and data access challenges, examine the solutions our community is currently deploying, and envision how to ensure vibrant CSCW research going forward.
