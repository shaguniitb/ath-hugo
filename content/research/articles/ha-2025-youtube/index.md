## Abstract

Autocomplete is a popular search feature that predicts queries based on user input and guides users to a set of potentially relevant suggestions. In this study, we examine what YouTube autocompletes suggest to users seeking information about race on the platform. Specifically, we perform an algorithm output audit of autocomplete suggestions for input queries about four racial groups and examine the stereotypes they embody. Using critical discourse analysis, we identify five major sociocultural contexts in which racial information appears—Appearance, Ability, Culture, Social Equity, and Manner. We found that the participatory nature of YouTube produces a multifaceted representation of race-related content in its search outputs, characterized by enduring historical biases, aggregated discrimination, and interracial tensions, while simultaneously depicting minority resistance and aspirations of a post-racial society. We call for innovations in content moderation policy design and enforcement to address existing racial harms in YouTube search outputs.
