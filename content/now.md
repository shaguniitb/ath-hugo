As of November 5, 2022, I'm spending all my time on these things:

* Recently moved to West Village, NYC. Enjoying the cute cafes and restaurants in the neighborhood!
* Redesigning and teaching a graduate course 'MI 587: Understanding, Designing and Building Social Media' for the first time. What a fun class to teach!
* Checking out New York city over the weekends
* Re-reading The Return of the King by JRR Tolkein
