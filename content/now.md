As of October 5, 2021, I'm spending all my time on these things:

* Settling into New Brunswick as I start my new job as an assistant professor in the School of Communication and Information at Rutgers University
* Checking out New York city over the weekends
* Teaching ITI 221: Fundamentals of Data Curation and Management in Fall 2021
* Finishing the third part of the Wolf Hall trilogy by Hilary Mantel
