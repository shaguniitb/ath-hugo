The Social Computing Lab is based in the School of Communication and Information at Rutgers University. Our goal is to **make the internet fairer, safer, and more inclusive**. We contribute empirical evidence that guides design and policy solutions to improve platform governance.

## Ongoing projects

- Examining search engine users' perceptions of the curation of search autocompletes.
- Analyzing social media users' engagement with inappropriate speech by politicians.
- Understanding the accessibility challenges of using safety tools on social media sites.
- Studying content creators' adoption of pinning inappropriate comments as a moderation strategy.
- Evaluating the effects of norm education strategies in online communities on newcomers.
- Designing, building, and analyzing the use of [personal moderation tools](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3610080). Exploring psychosocial factors that influence the adoption of these tools.
- Understanding how offline perceptions of race influence exposure, processing, and responses to race-based hate speech online. 
- Examining how content moderation influences gender performativity on Chinese platforms.
- Identifying support-seeking practices of people in inter-caste relationships on Reddit.
