The Social Computing Lab is based in the School of Communication and Information at Rutgers University. Our goal is to **make the internet fairer, safer, and more inclusive**. We contribute empirical evidence that guides design and policy solutions to improve platform governance.

## Ongoing projects

- Taking a user-centered approach to incorporate fairness, accountability, and transparency in flagging mechanisms at each stage --- before, during, and after flagging
- Using social psychology and communication theories to design warning labels against inappropriate content on social media sites and conducting controlled online experiments to evaluate the effects of those labels
- Designing, building, and analyzing the use of personal moderation tools. Exploring antecedents of support for platform-enacted moderation versus personal moderation tools
- Understanding public librarians' perspectives on content curation and moderation practices of large-scale digital distribution services
- Evaluating the effects of offering post-removal explanations on social media platforms
- Studying public perceptions of community-wide moderation interventions, including community bans and warning labels that precede community access. 
- Deriving empirical insights on the use of restorative justice practices to address online harassment
- Analyzing how visual cultures such as memes contribute to political polarization on social media sites
- Characterizing the landscape of multi-level governance structures in online social platforms, drawing from taxonomies of offline institutions, including federalism and polycentricity
