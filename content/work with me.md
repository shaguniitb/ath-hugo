I am looking to accept 1-2 doctoral students starting Fall 2022. If you are a prospective PhD student interested in working with me, please apply to the Rutgers SCI PhD program and mention me in your application materials. 

If you are a current SCI masterâ€™s or undergraduate student interested in working with me, please email me (sj917 [at] rutgers [dot] edu) with your CV/resume and research interests.

I am particularly interested in working with students who want to conduct computational or mixed-methods research on topics including (but not limited to):
1. Evaluating the effectiveness of moderation interventions
2. Understanding online harassment and designing solutions to address it
3. Incorporating fairness and transparency in content moderation systems
4. Examining the dynamics of online hate groups and devising ways to reduce their influence
