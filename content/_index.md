I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Library and Information Science in the [School of Communication and Information](https://comminfo.rutgers.edu) at Rutgers University. Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington. I received a PhD in computer science from the [School of Interactive Computing](https://ic.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech.

My research is focused on improving content moderation on digital platforms. My [lab](/lab) examines how the design, technical affordances, and policies of large-scale platforms influence the experiences of different stakeholders. I study online governance with an eye towards addressing societal issues such as online harassment and the rise of hate groups. My goal is to instill fairness and meaningful transparency in platform's communications with end-users. To achieve this goal,Â I use a variety of methods in my work, including system building, computational techniques, online experiments, surveys, and interviews.
