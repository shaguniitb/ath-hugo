I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Library and Information Science in the [School of Communication and Information](https://comminfo.rutgers.edu) at Rutgers University, where I direct the [Social Computing Lab](/lab). Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington. I received a PhD in computer science from the [School of Interactive Computing](https://ic.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech.

My research is focused on improving content moderation on digital platforms. I examine how the design, technical affordances, and policies of large-scale platforms influence the experiences of different stakeholders. I study online governance with an eye towards producing empirically informed solutions to societal issues such as online harassment and the rise of hate groups. I also aim to instill fairness and meaningful transparency in platform's communications with end-users. To achieve these goals,Â I use a variety of methods in my work, including system building, computational techniques, online experiments, surveys, and interviews.
