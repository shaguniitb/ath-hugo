I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Library and Information Science](https://comminfo.rutgers.edu/about/library-and-information-science-department/) at the School of Communication and Information at Rutgers University. Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington. I received a PhD in computer science from the [School of Interactive Computing](https://ic.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech.

I study the governance mechanisms of internet platforms to understand how their design, technical affordances, and policies affect public discourse. I use a mixed methods approach, combining system building, computational techniques, surveys, and interviews to explore how platforms can address societal issues such as online harassment and the rise of hate groups.
