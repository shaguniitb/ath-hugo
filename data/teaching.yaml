  - title: Quantitative Research Methods
    description: "The course is designed to provide students with solid grounding in the logic and practice of quantitative methodology in social scientific research. Special emphasis is placed on theory-driven quantitative research and on the critical and informed application of various quantitative data analysis techniques to modeling relationships and processes. Class meetings will be divided between critical discussion of conceptual and foundational issues (e.g., causation, probability, research design, measurement, modeling, and statistical inference) and hands-on exercises using IBM SPSS. Students will work independently outside of class to complete a series of individual assignments leading to a final, data-based paper that can be submitted to an academic conference and/or a peer-reviewed journal."

  - title: Designing a More Critical CS Education
    description: "Society and computational systems are deeply intertwined. In this course, students will explore how technologies can embody systemic social inequities by synthesizing selected texts into new educational materials that can be broadly valuable (e.g., other students can use these materials for self-study later, the material could be adopted by instructors nationally)."
